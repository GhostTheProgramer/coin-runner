This is The Plane game I made in 6th Grade thats why Its bad So to play it deploy it with github pages and it will work fine 
it uses processing 5 js and  sprite.js and 2 sprites from code.org.

So thanks to code.org and my brother for helping me with this.

To See the game play itself on the main menu that asks for bot or normal type bot in the text field then click enter.
